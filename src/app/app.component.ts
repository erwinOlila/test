  aboutMe = `
    I am an electrical engineer who is currently studying Control Systems in my
    masters in University of San Carlos. I have experience in embedded systems,
    circuit design, soldering, 3D modelling and wireless communications which I
    learned while working with my thesis. I also have experience as a test
    engineer so I am confident with my debugging skills.
    I am also interested in DIY, aquaponics, robotics, web development, video games and also space exploration.
